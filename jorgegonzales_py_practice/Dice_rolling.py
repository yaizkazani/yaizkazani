# Dice Rolling Simulator
#
# By using the random module, Python can do things like pseudo-random number generation.
#
#     Allow the user to input the amount of sides on a dice and how many times it should be rolled.
#     Your program should simulate dice rolls and keep track of how many times each number comes up (this does not have to be displayed).
#     Finally, print out how many times each number came up.
#     Subgoals:
#         Adjust your program so that if the user does not type in a number when they need to, the program will keep prompting them to type in
#         a real number until they do so.
#         Put the program into a loop so that the user can continue to simulate dice rolls without having to restart the entire program.
#         In addition to printing out how many times each side appeared, also print out the percentage it appeared. If you can,
#         round the percentage to 4 digits total OR two decimal places.
