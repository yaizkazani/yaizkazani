# What's My Number?
#
# Between 1 and 1000, there is only 1 number that meets the following criteria:
#
#     The number has two or more digits.
#     The number is prime.
#     The number does NOT contain a 1 or 7 in it.
#     The sum of all of the digits is less than or equal to 10.
#     The first two digits add up to be odd.
#     The second to last digit is even and greater than 1.
#     The last digit is equal to how many digits are in the number.
