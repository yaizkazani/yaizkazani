# Rock Paper Scissors Game
#
#     Create a rock-paper-scissors game.
#     Ask the player to pick rock, paper or scissors.
#     Have the computer chose its move.
#     Compare the choices and decide who wins.
#     Print the results.
#     Subgoals:
#         Give the player the option to play again.
#         Keep a record of the score (e.g. Player: 3 / Computer: 6).
